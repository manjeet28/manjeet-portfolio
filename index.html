        <p>
          <span>Name: Real Time Object Detection Using Yolov3 in Pytorch</span></br>
          <span>Description: Led the team in creating an object and video detection using the YOLO
          algorithm implemented using neural networks. Used Pytorch as well as various image
          processing libraries.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Name: Live Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Vader</span></br>
          <span>Description: Conceived sentiment analysis on live streaming tweets using VADER lexicon.
            Used tweepy to access twitter data. Created a dynamic database updated in real time. Used
            various charts and heat maps to visualize the sentiments.</span>
